# Tenacious Jack Rabbit

This is based on the awesome work of EtteGit https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject. I found inspiration from sneakytreesnake https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/SturdyBunnyProject.

# Motivation

After doing some research before building the ERCF I found a lot of people saying there was flex in the assembly that was causing issues with operation. The suggestion was to go with the SturdyBunnyProject. This added a 2020 extrusion in place of the 5mm threaded rods. The only down side to this design in my opinion was it changed the print orientation of the filament block from upright to laying sideways which then required supports to print the filament blocks. I decided to change the location of the 2020 extrusion to allow printing the filament block in the designed orientation to be able to print without supports.
