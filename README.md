# Tenacious Jack Rabbit

This is still a work in progress! I have everything assembled but have not set it up yet. I have printed all of the parts I redesigned and they all fit snuggly. If you decide to try this please let me know if you encounter any issues. I will att empt to correct any issues that come up. I will be updating as necessary. I have included Gerbox front, filament block and filament blocks end with supports incase someones printer can't successfully print it without. I printed mine without supports and had very minamal cleanup to get them to fit.

This is based on the awesome work of EtteGit https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject. I also found inspiration from the awesome work of sneakytreesnake (https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/SturdyBunnyProject).

# Motivation

After doing some research before building the ERCF I found a lot of people saying there was flex in the assembly that was causing issues with operation. The suggestion was to go with the SturdyBunnyProject. This added a 2020 extrusion in place of the 5mm threaded rods. The only down side to this design in my opinion was it changed the print orientation of the filament block from upright to laying sideways which then required supports to print the filament blocks. I decided to change the location of the 2020 extrusion to allow printing the filament block in the designed orientation to be able to print without supports.

# Changes to BOM

|Qty|Description|
|:---:|---|
|1|2020 Extrusion one end with M6 taped hole (1)|
|1|M6x10 BHCS|
|2|M3 T-nuts (2)|
|7|M3x8 SHCS (2)|
|3|M5 T-nuts|
|3|M5x10 BHCS|

* (1) 171mm for 6, 234mm for 9 and 297mm for 12. These are minimum lengths, can be longer if you want.
* (2) Only needed for mounting ERB to 2020 exrtusion

# Assembly

To assemble you have to attach the 2020 extrusion to the Gearbox_Front_2020_Mount with the M6x10 before assembling the gearbox. The filament blocks and bearing blocks slide on to the 2020 extrusion instead of the 5mm rods in the assembly manual. The Filament_Blocks_End goes on after the last filament block and should be tight against the last filament block. 2 M5 BHCS and M5 T-nuts attach it to the 2020 extrusion. There should be no air gaps between the gearbox front and the Filament Blocks End.
