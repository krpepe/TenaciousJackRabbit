# Tenacious Jack Rabbit

This is based on the awesome work of EtteGit https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject. I found inspiration from sneakytreesnake https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/SturdyBunnyProject.

# Motivation

After doing some research before building the ERCF I found a lot of people saying there was flex in the assembly that was causing issues with operation. The suggestion was to go with the SturdyBunnyProject. This added a 2020 extrusion in place of the 5mm threaded rods.
